# <Marketing-Agency-Homework>

## Description

This project was to further my understanding of improving already made code and trying to improve upon it to develop my skills in html and css.
I built this project to learn about refactoring someone elses code and how to identify issues in others work.
There were excessive and unnecessary css elements, the code has been condensed to be more efficient.
I have learned a lot about the use of id and class selectors and how they interact with css elements.
